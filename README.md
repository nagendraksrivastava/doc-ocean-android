# doc-ocean-patient-app

Doc-Ocean was a startup launched in 2015 with an aim of uberising health care, the idea was to connect patients to the nearby health care professionals (Doctor, Nurses) and avail of the services in the comfort of home.

Patient App Android was built for patients where they can see nearby health care professionals on the google map, and they can create a request in real-time.

Unfortunately we shutdown the startup in the 6-month span of time because of a lack of financial backup while we needed many government approvals to run the business for healthcare startups.

We have decided to opensource this so that others can get benefited from our hard work and passion.

This was getting used by patients to book the nearby health care professionals in real time.
